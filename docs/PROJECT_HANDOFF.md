# Project handoff — InkLink Clock Studio

> **Canonical handoff / single starting point for future chats and contributors**
>
> **Last consolidated:** 14 October 2026 (Australia/Sydney).
>
> **Status:** GitHub Pages deployed, automated tests passing, and **the corrected NRF- EPD+RXTX two-service connection was confirmed on the user's physical clock on 14 October 2026 at approximately 19:01 Sydney time**. The 1.5-second idle connection test passed. Notifications, time sync, display mode changes, and 10+ second reliability remain untested.
>
> **Next action:** On the same Android Chrome device, keep/re-establish Safe connection, verify it remains linked for 10–15 seconds, press **1. Enable notifications** and inspect the log; if successful, perform **Sync date & time** and verify the physical screen. Keep NRF- image transfer disabled.

## Goal and scope

Build a clean **English-language Web Bluetooth application** to connect to, control and eventually design custom e-paper displays for a Chinese-manufactured battery-powered desk clock. GitHub Pages hosts the static HTML/CSS/ES-module JavaScript UI. No backend is required for current features. This is **BLE configuration and image transfer**, not firmware flashing or microcontroller reprogramming.

Long-term: English interface, live clock/calendar control, configurable screen layouts, safely uploading static custom artwork, and possibly extended dashboard features if hardware/data delivery allow. A static image is **not** a continuously updating standalone clock face.

## Hardware context (observed vs unknown)

- Initial user photo (14 Oct 2026) shows a white e-paper desk clock with large segmented time, Chinese solar/lunar calendar and date, temperature, battery voltage, and a solar-term countdown. The display appears black/white/red. Screen size, exact display controller, SoC and firmware version **not verified**.
- User demonstrated that the actual clock can be configured using XLY95 via BLE.
- The clock advertised as **NRF-6CD319** during Android Chrome troubleshooting, i.e., it has a **hyphen**, not an underscore. Do not assume devices starting with `NRF-` are unrelated.
- The user tested from Android Chrome (and earlier showed an iPhone browser screenshot). Standard Safari/Chrome on iOS does not expose normal Web Bluetooth. For repeatable checks, use the **same Android phone/browser** for InkLink and XLY95.
- User's nRF Connect Mobile screenshot showed Generic Access 0x1800, Generic Attribute 0x1801, Battery 0x180F, Device Information 0x180A, 0xFEF5, custom EPD 13187b10-eba9-a3ba-044e-83d3217d9a38, 0x1F10, and 0x221F. The screenshot was taken with the app showing DISCONNECTED, but displays a discovered service list. No need to publicly store screenshots/MAC addresses.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY — two distinct protocols

XLY95's main website and standalone `js.js` **do not use the same BLE protocol**. The initial InkLink implementation inspected the standalone `js.js`, which explains the repeated service-not-found errors when connecting to the user's `NRF-` clock. After inspecting the actual `index.html`, we found the matching service **present in the nRF Connect screenshot**.

| | Actual user's `NRF-` profile | Legacy `NRF_` profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original code | XLY95 `index.html` | XLY95 `js.js` |
| EPD service | `13187b10-eba9-a3ba-044e-83d3217d9a38` | `32120001-0bf6-448a-9608-1b01a1a8f75c` |
| EPD characteristic | `4b646063-6264-f3a7-8941-e65356ea82fe` | `32120002-0bf6-448a-9608-1b01a1a8f75c` |
| Clock-control service | `00001f10-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Same characteristic |
| Clock-control characteristic | `00001f1f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` | Same characteristic |
| Clock/calendar | RXTX `E1 02` + `E2` / `E1 01` + `E2` | `AE 01` / `AE 02` |
| Time setting | `DD` + local-adjusted epoch/year/month/day/weekday; then `E2` | `A3` + big-endian Unix seconds |
| Image transfer | Different frame/offset format (`03`/`04`) — **not yet implemented** | `A1` packet chunks supported in app, not hardware-validated |
| Connection support | Implemented in current source; **awaiting actual hardware test** | Implemented from source; no hardware validation |

More exact wire-level details, source references and caveats are in [BLE_PROTOCOLS.md](BLE_PROTOCOLS.md). **Never write legacy A1, A3, AE or A5 commands to the actual NRF- profile.**

## Timeline of debugging (14 October 2026)

1. Created the English-language InkLink app, uploaded it to this new public GitHub repository, set up GitHub Pages and Actions; automated protocol tests passed. App included BLE discovery, time/modes, English image preview, image upload and activity log.
2. Device initially not found in InkLink; XLY95 could find it. Broadened scanner and added browser diagnostics. User later selected `NRF-6CD319`.
3. On Android and iPhone tests, GATT was sometimes established and disconnected; added Safe connection mode, connection-stage log, separate notification/info buttons and service retry.
4. Repeated errors: `getPrimaryService NotFoundError: No Services matching UUID 32120001-...` and `getPrimaryServices: No Services found in device`. These came from querying the **wrong (legacy)** service. One separate attempt failed during `gatt.connect()` with `NetworkError: Connection Error: Connection attempt failed`. An occasional link failure does not establish a permanent device problem.
5. Tried 300 ms wait after choosing BLE device and another short wait before GATT discovery; the missing-service error persisted. Delay-only changes were not the solution.
6. Incorrectly focused on `NRF-` vs `NRF_` names as evidence of a wrong peripheral. User confirmed XLY95 itself selects `NRF-XXXXXX`. Corrected that assumption and supports both names.
7. User installed nRF Connect and provided service list showing 13187b10..., 1F10 and 221F, **not** 32120001... .
8. Inspected XLY95 `index.html` (rather than standalone `js.js`) and confirmed its `NRF-` name filter; EPD service/characteristic; RXTX service/characteristic; 2-channel connect; `DD`, `E1`, `E2` operations.
9. Added automatic profile selection in `src/app.mjs` and protocol-specific helpers in `src/protocol.mjs`, new tests, app safety guard disabling NRF- image uploads, and corrected README. GitHub Actions finished successfully with **9 protocol tests**.
10. **New first hardware SUCCESS at approximately 19:01 on 14 Oct:** user Activity Log confirmed `NRF- RXTX characteristic discovered`, `Protocol profile: NRF- EPD + RXTX (XLY95 main page)`, `EPD capabilities: write, notify`, `RXTX write capability: true`, and `BLE stage: connected and stable` after the 1.5-second idle test. In Safe mode, **no notifications and no writes were sent**. Details in [TEST_HISTORY.md](TEST_HISTORY.md), Test record G.

See [TEST_HISTORY.md](TEST_HISTORY.md) for more precise evidence and how to interpret old logs.

## What the app currently does (implemented, not all hardware-verified)

- Static GitHub Pages build: `index.html`, `src/styles.css`, `src/app.mjs`, `src/protocol.mjs`. Runs in a Web Bluetooth-capable HTTPS browser.
- Browser device picker defaults to names beginning `NRF-` or `NRF_`; optional broad scan.
- Auto-selects **dash** profile for `NRF-` and **legacy** profile for `NRF_`, requests the appropriate optional services, and discovers matching characteristics.
- **Safe connection** checkbox checked by default, with no automatic commands. Explicit Enable notifications; info/A9 request only in legacy profile.
- Logs GATT stages, service/characteristic discovery and write errors; reconnect/discovery troubleshooting.
- Correct `NRF-` time sync on RXTX (DD + E2) and built-in clock/calendar modes (E1 02 or E1 01 then E2) are coded and tested by unit tests, **not yet tested against physical clock**.
- English screen preview and PNG export. Legacy image transfer remains behind legacy profile. **NRF- image upload intentionally blocked** until its distinct image framing is implemented.
- Unit tests use `node --test tests/protocol.test.mjs`; GitHub Actions also checks JS syntax and deploys to Pages after tests.

## EXACT next test / acceptance checkpoint

**CONNECTION MILESTONE REACHED (observed 14 Oct 2026 ~19:01):** Android InkLink logs confirm EPD and RXTX characteristic discovery and correct `NRF-` profile. The initial 1.5-second stable check passed with no startup commands. This is **measured device evidence**, not merely CI/source testing. The user has **not** yet confirmed longer connection duration, notification subscription, or a successful physical time/mode change.

1. If the existing Android Chrome session remains connected, observe 10–15 seconds of stability. If not, close XLY95/nRF Connect sessions, reload live InkLink, keep **Safe connection checked**, and reconnect to the same `NRF-` clock.
2. Press **1. Enable notifications** only. Wait a few seconds and inspect the Activity Log for `notifications enabled` or a precise error.
3. If still connected, press **Sync date & time** once. This writes `DD` local time payload plus `E2` to RXTX. Check the physical screen for correct local time/date; an acknowledged write alone isn't proof.
4. Optionally test Clock/Calendar mode buttons one by one and confirm actual screen response.
5. If anything fails, share the **full log near the failure**, including preceding BLE stages. Record results in `TEST_HISTORY.md`. Do not send image uploads to `NRF-` yet.

**Acceptance:** 10+ second stable connection, successful notification subscription, and visibly correct physical time or mode change. Do not conflate the already confirmed first 1.5-second connection with acceptance of all controls.

## Remaining work, in order

P0. **DONE (physical):** Correct NRF- EPD and RXTX services/characteristics discovered and initial 1.5-second Safe connection stable on 14 Oct at 19:01. **Still pending:** 10+ second stability.
P0. **NEXT:** Verify notification subscription and clock time/mode writes on actual hardware, one operation at a time.
P1. Implement `NRF-` image upload using upstream page's EPD framing, plane conversions and its supported display dimensions; add offline unit tests / byte-for-byte references before using hardware. Keep uploads disabled until validated.
P1. Fix any UI or connection regressions found by device logs, and keep the two profiles separate.
P2. Identify exact physical display geometry, implement accurate English designs and optional display-related controls.
P3. Explore scheduling, reliable reconnects, weather/calendar data; recognize browsers need to stay open or another gateway is needed for live feeds.
P4. Consider firmware reprogramming *only as a separate hardware investigation*, not the current BLE app goal.

## How to resume in a new ChatGPT chat

Give the next assistant this repository and tell it **to read this handoff first, then BLE_PROTOCOLS.md, TEST_HISTORY.md and ROADMAP.md, and inspect the current source before editing**. Because this repository is public and the GitHub connector is connected, use the GitHub app/connector to fetch current `main` files and check Actions. Do **not** answer from the stale standalone HTML download or old chat snippets.

Suggested message to paste:

> Continue my InkLink Clock Studio project at https://github.com/LioncityDownUnder/inklink-clock-studio . Read docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md, docs/BLE_PROTOCOLS.md, docs/TEST_HISTORY.md, docs/ROADMAP.md and AGENTS.md from the current main branch before making changes. We have an NRF- e-paper desk clock; the old 32120001 protocol was wrong for this model. The correct XLY95 index.html protocol (13187b10 EPD service + 1F10 RXTX service) is implemented and its first physical connection succeeded at about 19:01 on 14 Oct 2026. Help me test 10+ second connection stability, notifications, and physical time sync; update GitHub documentation as we go.

## Rules for future project updates

1. Check current `main` before changes; never blindly overwrite user commits.
2. Make code changes only after identifying whether they apply to `NRF-`, `NRF_`, or both.
3. Always label claims as **confirmed on device**, **confirmed from source**, **automated-tested only**, or **hypothesis**.
4. After each meaningful test or code update: add dated evidence to `TEST_HISTORY.md`; update current status/next action here; adjust `ROADMAP.md` and protocol doc if the knowledge changed; check Actions.
5. No firmware erase, unverified write commands, or image upload on unvalidated NRF- framing.
6. Avoid committing phone MAC address, account identifiers, BLE device keys, or private screenshots to this public repo. The device's displayed name is included only for continuity.
